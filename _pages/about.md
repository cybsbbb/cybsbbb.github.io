I am a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.ucr.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Riverside</a> (UCR), expected to graduate in Fall 2024. Before that, I received my Master degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a> (USC) in 2019, and Bachelor degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China</a> (USTC) in 2016.

My research is focused on time-series modeling and forecasting, trustworthy and reliable machine learning, and anomaly detection in time-series data, with a focus on the applications in Transmission Power Systems. I am now working on how to build a reliable spatial-temporal machine learning model in a power system.

In the past, I have been working at Robert Bosch LLC for a half-year internship, mainly involved in building the Big Data pipelines to support manufacturing analysis, and have been working at Spatial Computing Lab at USC for one year, mainly involved in building deep learning model for digital map text detection, building system to support large-scale spatial data mining.

I am an ACM enthusiast and enjoy participating in ACM competitions. Although I am not very skilled, I love it. Here are my <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/cybsbbb">Codeforces</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/cybsbbbb/">LeetCode</a> profiles.

My personal Webpage is still under construction. My research and publication details will be updated soon.
